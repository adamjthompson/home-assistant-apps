# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Initial version: Playwright-driven login to CenterPoint Energy (Azure AD B2C -- confirmed real login URL and sign-in field IDs `#signInName`/`#password`/`#rememberMe`/`#next`, with browser-session persistence across runs and a Gmail IMAP fallback for the occasional emailed 2FA code), scraping the billing-history table (Reading Date / Meter Reading / Therms), converting Therms to kWh, and importing each meter-read cycle as an external Home Assistant statistic (`centerpoint_gas:cycle_usage`) ready to add as an Energy Dashboard gas source. Meter number/installation ID are account-specific config options, not hardcoded. The 2FA-challenge page itself and its email-search pattern are still unconfirmed placeholders pending a real login attempt -- see the README's "First-run debugging" section.
